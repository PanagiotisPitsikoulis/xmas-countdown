          When someone follows a startup's<br />
          Instagram account, they are<br />
          supporting the company by staying<br />
          up to date with their latest<br />
          products, services, and events.<br />
          This can help to increase<br />
          engagement and interest in the<br />
          startup's offerings, which can<br />
          ultimately lead to increased<br />
          support to the services provided.
